/** This class simulates an unreliable network that may lose, duplicate or delay messages. It was made together with [[IAntiEntropy]]
  * to locally test the correctness of Delta CRDTs in unreliable networks. The network can be made reliable for certain
  * phases only by using the startReliablePhase and endReliablePhase methods.
  *
  * @param lossChance A value between 0 and 1 describing the likelihood that a message is lost in transfer. For example,
  *                   a network with lossChance 0 will deliver every message while a network with lossChance 0.5 will lose
  *                   50% of all messages.
  * @param duplicateChance A value between 0 and 1 describing the likelihood that a received message is duplicated, i.e.
  *                        it is not removed from the internal buffer when it is passed on to the anti-entropy algorithm.
  *                        Note that a message that was left in the buffer might be duplicated again the next time that
  *                        messages are retrieved. For example, assuming a lossChance of 0, a network with duplicateChance 0
  *                        will deliver every message exactly once, while a network with duplicateChance 0.5 delivers a
  *                        message just once with a 50% chance, twice with a 25% chance, three times with a 12.5% chance
  *                        and so on.
  * @param delayChance A value between 0 and 1 describing the likelihood that a message gets delayed during transfer, i.e.
  *                    that it does not get retrieved in a call to receiveMessages. For example, assuming a lossChance of 0,
  *                    in a network with delayChance 0 every message can be retrieved in the first call to receiveMessages
  *                    after the message was sent, while in a network with delayChance 0.5 there is a 50% chance that the
  *                    message is retrieved by the first call to receiveMessages, a 25% chance for the second call, a
  *                    12.5% chance for the third call and so on.
